# Data Structures in Python

In Python, **lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries** are commonly used data structures. They help us **store, organize, and manage information** efficiently.

---

# Lists

Lists are used to organize data in an easy and flexible way.

Each element inside a list has an **index**, starting from `0`.

List data is written inside **square brackets** `[ ]`.

### Key characteristics

- Ordered
- Changeable (mutable)
- Allows duplicate values

### Example:

```python
my_list = ["Kevin", "KevinMirandaDev", True, 1.75]
```

# Tuples

Tuples are useful when you want to store data that **should not be changed**.

Tuple data is written inside **parentheses** `( )`.

### Key characteristics

- Ordered (each element has an index)
- Immutable (cannot be changed)
- Allows duplicate values

### Example

```python
# This is a tuple
my_tuple = ("Kevin","KevinMirandaDev",True,1.75)

```

# Sets

Sets are used to store **unordered data** with **no duplicate elements**.

Set data is written inside **curly braces** `{ }`.

### Key characteristics

- Unordered
- Does not allow duplicate values
- No access to elements by index

### Example

```python
# This is a set
my_set = {"Kevin","KevinMirandaDev",True,1.75}

```

---

# Dictionaries

Dictionaries store data in **key: value** pairs.

Dictionary data is written inside **curly braces** `{ }`.

### Key characteristics

- Indexed by keys (not by numbers)
- Organized as key:value pairs
- Keys must be unique
- Values can be changed (mutable)

### Example

```python
# This is a dictionary
my_dict = {
"name":"Kevin",
"github":"KevinMirandaDev",
"is_active":True,
"height":1.75
}

```

```python

That's it. Whoever reads this, hope you learnt something from this repo :)
Small steps, every day. Soli Deo Gloria.
