Operators in Python

This file is part of my personal journey learning Python.
I already understood some of these concepts before, but I still write them here to keep a clear record of my progress and stay disciplined in my learning.

My goal is not to be perfect.
My goal is to improve step by step.

Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators help us do basic math with numbers in Python.

Addition

The + operator adds two values.

3 + 2  # result: 5

Subtraction

The - operator subtracts one number from another.

5 - 3  # result: 2

Multiplication

The * operator multiplies numbers.

4 * 2  # result: 8

Division

The / operator divides numbers and returns a float value.

10 / 2  # result: 5.0

Floor division

The // operator divides but keeps only the integer part of the result.

10 // 3  # result: 3

Modulo

The % operator returns the remainder of a division.

´´´python
10 % 3  # result: 1
´´´

Power

The ** operator raises a number to a power.

2 ** 3  # result: 8

Logical operators

Logical operators work with boolean values: True and False.
They are very important for decision making in programs.

AND

The and operator is True only when both values are True.

True and False  # result: False

OR

The or operator is True when at least one value is True.

True or False  # result: True

NOT

The not operator changes a value to the opposite boolean.

not True  # result: False

Personal note

I am learning Python with patience and consistency.
Sometimes the basics feel simple, but I believe strong fundamentals build strong developers.

This repository is my way to document the process, stay accountable, and show real progress over time.

Small steps, every day.

Bible verse

“Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.”
