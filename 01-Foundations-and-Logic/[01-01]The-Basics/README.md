# [01-01] The Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming.
These basics are essential to understand how Python works and how programs are structured.

## Variables

Variables are names that reference values stored in memory.
In Python, you assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (`=`).

The type of the variable depends on the value assigned to it.

Example:
```python
greetings = "Hello World!"
```
## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types. Some of the most common ones are:

### String (str)
Represents text data.
Example:
```python
message = "Hello"
```

### Integer (int)
Represents whole numbers.
Example:
```python
number = 2
```

### Float (float)
Represents decimal numbers.
Example:
```python
pi = 3.14
```

### Boolean (bool)
Represents logical values: True or False.
Example:
```python
is_active = True
```

### None (NoneType)
Represents the absence of a value.
It is often used as a placeholder to assign a value later.
Example:
```python
result = None
```
## Comments
Comments are used to explain code and make it easier to understand.
In Python, comments start with the # symbol.

Example:
```python
# This is a comment
```
## print()
The print() function is used to display output in the console.

Example:
print("Hello, world!")
## f-strings
F-strings allow you to insert variables directly into strings.
They make string formatting easier and more readable.

Example:
```python
name = "Kevin"
print(f"Hello world, my name is {name}")
```
## input()
The input() function allows you to receive input from the user.
The value returned by input() is always a string.

Example:
```python
user_text = input("Write your text right here: ")
```


These are the Python basics. Knowing this, we can continue our journey.
