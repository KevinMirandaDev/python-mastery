# What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language designed to be easy to read and write.
It focuses on simplicity and clarity, allowing developers to express ideas with clean and readable code.

## 🔍 Key Characteristics

- **High-level language**  
  Python abstracts low-level details, so developers can focus on solving problems instead of managing memory or hardware.

- **Interpreted**  
  Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, which makes development and debugging easier.

- **Dynamically typed**  
  You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly. The type is determined at runtime.

- **General-purpose**  
  Python can be used in many different fields, not just one specific area.
